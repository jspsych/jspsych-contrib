# jspsych-rok plugin

This plugin displays oriented objects (oobs) that move and allows the participant to report the primary direction of motion or the primary orientation by pressing a key on the keyboard. 
The stimulus can be displayed until a keyboard response is given or until a certain duration of time has passed. Oobs are objects that have an orientation (e.g. triangles).

We would appreciate it if you cited this paper when you use the plugin:

## Parameters

Parameters can be left unspecified if the default value is acceptable. If more then one aperture is displayed most of the parameters should be specified as array (specified by the array column). The elements of the array then apply to the corresponding aperture. In addition to the [parameters available in all plugins](https://www.jspsych.org/latest/overview/plugins/#parameters-available-in-all-plugins), the parameters for this plugin are as follows:

### Image Loading
If image are key framed, the keyframes must be loaded as one picture in a frame sheet. Keyframes are next to each other. If the image should be mirrored, a mirrored version of the image must be in the same sheet below the original keyframe.


## Data Generated

In addition to the [default data collected by all plugins](https://www.jspsych.org/latest/overview/plugins/#data-collected-by-all-plugins), this plugin collects all parameter data described above and the following data for each trial.

|Name|Type|Value|

|rt|numeric|The response time in ms for the participant to make a response.|
|key_press|numeric|The key that the participant pressed. The value corresponds to the Javascript Char Code (Key Code).|
|correct|boolean|Whether or not the participant's key press corresponded to those provided in correct_choice.|
|frame_rate|numeric|The average frame rate for the trial. 0 denotes that the participant responded before the appearance of the second frame.|
|number_of_frames|numeric|The number of frames that was shown in this trial.|
|frame_rate_array|JSON string|The array that holds the number of milliseconds for each frame in this trial.|
|canvas_width|numeric|The width of the canvas in pixels.|
|canvas_height|numeric|The height of the canvas in pixels.|
                

## Features missing 

The feature to draw a border around the aperture is not implemented yet. Also the feature to present a fixation cross behind the oobs is not implemented yet. (Both features were implemented in the RDK plugin.)

## Examples
### Setting the correct_choice parameter by linking it to the coherent_direction parameter.
```javascript
let trial = {
            type: jsPsychRok,
            choices: ['f'],
            correct_choice: ['f'],
            trial_duration: 0
        }
```
### Setting the coherent_orientation to right (50% pointing right, 30% pointing left, 20% pointing random).
```javascript
    let trial =  {
        type:jsPsychRok,
        prompt: 'Welcome to the demo of a fully cusomizable rok task, >F< to continue',
        choices: ['f', 'j'],
        correct_choice: ['f'],
        coherent_orientation: 0, // orientation to the right
        coherent_movement_direction: 90, // movement up
        coherence_orientation: 50, // 50% are orientated right
        coherence_orientation_opposite: 30, // 30% are orientated left (rest random)
    };
```
### The coherent_movement to up (70% percent moving up, 30% moving random). Setting a prompt. 
```javascript
    let trial =  {
        type:jsPsychRok,
        prompt: 'Welcome to the demo of a fully cusomizable rok task, >F< to continue',
        choices: ['f', 'j'],
        correct_choice: ['f'],
        coherent_movement_direction: 90, // movement up
        coherence_movement: 70, // 
        coherence_movement_opposite:30,
    };
```

### Setting animated images as stimulus. Fade out images on the edges of the aperture. Mirror images instead of rotating them all the way (no upside down birds)
```javascript
    let trial =  {
        type:jsPsychRok,
        choices: ['f', 'j'],
        correct_choice: ['f'],
        fade_out: 1,
        stimulus_type: 4, // Make type image (0-triangles, 1-circle, 2-square, 3-origami_birds, 4-image)
        number_of_oobs: 100,
        oob_size: 10,
        stimulus_image: ['./res/img/stimuli/bird1_4.png'],
        stimulus_image_keyframes:4, // There are 4 frames in the image
        stimulus_keyframe_time: .1, // times between frames
        stimulus_mirror: 1,
    };
```
### Set congruency mode to 2 so that movement and orientation of incoherent oobs match. Randomise movement speed (not direction!) so that oobs move with different speed.
```javascript
    let trial =  {
        type:jsPsychRok,
        choices: ['f', 'j'],
        correct_choice: ['f'],
        fade_out: 1,
        stimulus_type: 4, // Make type image (0-triangles, 1-circle, 2-square, 3-origami_birds, 4-image)
        number_of_oobs: 100,
        oob_size: 10,
        stimulus_image: ['./res/img/stimuli/bird1_4.png'],
        stimulus_image_keyframes:4,
        stimulus_keyframe_time: .1,
        stimulus_mirror: 1,
        coherent_orientation: 0,
        coherent_movement_direction: 0,
        coherence_orientation: 0, // all random orientation
        coherence_orientation_opposite: 0, // all random orientation
        coherence_movement:50, // 50 percent coherent movement
        coherence_movement_opposite:0,  
        experiment_congruency_mode: 2,
        experiment_main_task: 0,
        movement_speed_randomisation: 40,
    };
```

### Setting randomisation to non static (random orientation as well as movement direction change over time). Setting type to animated origami bird
```javascript
    let trial =  {
        type:jsPsychRok,
        choices: ['f', 'j'],
        correct_choice: ['f'],
        stimulus_type: 3, // 0 - triangle, 1-circle, 2-square, 3-origamiBird 4-image
        random_movement_type: 1,
        random_orientation_type: 1,
    };
```

### Layering apertures to create random distractors
```javascript
    let trial = {
        type: jsPsychRok,
        choices: ['f', 'j'],
        correct_choice: ['f'],
        trial_duration: 0, 
        coherent_movement_direction: [90,90],
        coherent_orientation: [90,90], 
        coherence_movement: [90,0],
        coherence_orientation: [90,0], 
        coherence_movement_opposite: [10,0], 
        coherence_orientation_opposite: [10,0], 
        movement_speed: [2,5],
        movement_speed_randomisation: [0,50], 
        oob_color: ['green','red'], 
        oob_size: [3,1],
        stimulus_type: [0,1],
        aperture_width: 200,
        aperture_height: 600,
        aperture_shape: 1,  
      
        fade_out: 1,
    };
```
