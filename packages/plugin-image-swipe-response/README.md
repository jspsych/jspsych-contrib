# image-swipe-response

## Overview

This plugin displays image content and records responses generated by both swipe gestures and keyboard response. This is ideal for two-alternative forced choice assessments that will be administered on both mobile and desktop platforms. The stimulus can be displayed until a response is given, or for a pre-determined amount of time. The trial can be ended automatically if the participant has failed to respond within a fixed length of time.
