  The plugin-slider is a jspsych plugin that creates an
  interactive slider interface similar to the "slide to
  unlock" functionality found on mobile devices. Users must
  drag a slider handle to complete the trial, making it
  useful for consent screens, engagement checks, or
  transition screens in psychological experiments.
