# extension-meye

Current version: 1.0.0.

This extension collects pupillometric data using mEye. mEye is a deep-learning model available for public use at https://www.pupillometry.it/, and this extension adapts it to JsPsych. After calibrating the extension with the meye plugin (which must be a trial called before any trial using the extension), this extension runs in the background when added to any trial thereafter. 

Minimum requirements are a 720p 30fps webcam. The corresponding plugin must be called as a trial once in the experiment before using any trial can use the mEye extension. Original mEye website credits: Raffaele Mazziotti1, Fabio Carrara, Giuseppe Amato, and Tommaso Pizzorusso.

## Parameters

This extension accepts one parameter. If unspecified, the extension will not collect any data.

| Parameter           | Type             | Default Value      | Description                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| detection_interval  | numeric      	 | null        | Specifies how often (in ms) the extension takes a snapshot of the user's pupil. Due to how JavaScript works, this will typically have a mild error averaging 0.014ms, but up to 0.04ms has been observed. |

## Data Generated

This extension collects the following data. This extension measures the pupil at every interval specified by the parameter detection_interval. However, if the trial ends before the next interval is due, the extension will prematurely take a measurement as the trial ends and cancel the measurement that would occur when the trial no longer exists. For this reason, the last pupil measurement may be very soon after the second last measurement and this will be reflected in the data generated below. Due to how JavaScript works, the last measurement may also delay the trial ending by up to .04 s.

| Name      | Type    | Value                                    |
| --------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| pupil_diameter  | numeric  | The diameter of the user's pupil at the time of snapshot, in pixels relative to the participant's monitor. The participant is assumed to have circular pupils because diameter is reported. |
| blink_prob  | numeric | The probability that the user was blinking at the time of snapshot. Is between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates that the extension is certain that the user was blinking. |
| timecode	| numeric	| The seconds (rounded to three decimal places) since the start of the extension-trial dyad that the snapshot was taken, including the moment a trial starts and ends. Due to JavaScript, this cannot be perfectly accurate and an error of up to 30ms occurs on the developer's computer. |

## Install

Using the downloaded jspsych-contrib folder:

```js
<script src="jspsych-contrib/packages/extension-meye/dist/index.browser.min.js"></script>
```

## Examples

Ensure that the **plugin** is a trial in the timeline before adding the extension to any trial thereafter.

```javascript
var meyeCalibrate = {
	type: jsPsychMeyeConfig,
};
		
var useExtension = {
	type: jsPsychHtmlKeyboardResponse,
	stimulus: '<img id="some-image" src="some-image.png"/>',
	trial_duration: 600,
	response_ends_trial: false,
	data: { task: 'webcam1', US: 'no'},
	extensions: [{ type: jsPsychExtensionMeye, params: {detection_interval: 100} }]
}
```
