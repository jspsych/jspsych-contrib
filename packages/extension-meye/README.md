# meye extension

## Overview

This extension collects pupillometric data using Meye, a deep-learning model developed by Fabio Carrara. He made it to run on a website for public use at https://www.pupillometry.it/, and this extension adapts it to JsPsych. After calibrating the extension with the meye plugin (which must be a trial called before any trial using the extension), this extension runs in the background when added to any trial thereafter. 

Minimum requirements are a 720p 30fps webcam. 

## Compatibility

Developed using jsPsych v7.3

## Documentation
