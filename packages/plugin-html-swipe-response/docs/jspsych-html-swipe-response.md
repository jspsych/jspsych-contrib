# jspsych-html-swipe-response plugin

This plugin displays HTML content and records responses generated by swipe gestures, keyboard, and button responses. This plugin will be useful for two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) assessments that will be administered on both desktop and mobile devices. The stimulus can be animated to move off-screen before the trial ends. The stimulus can be displayed until a response is given, or for a pre-determined amount of time. The trial can be ended automatically if the participant has failed to respond within a fixed length of time. After the user responds a `'responded'` css class gets added to the stimulus and to the button corresponding to their choice.

Setting the `stimulus_duration` parameter while using the swipe modality can result in a user experience issue, wherein the user must swipe a stimulus div tag that has been hidden after the stimulus duration has elapsed. To solve this, this plugin wraps the stimulus div tag in another tag with the ID `#jspsych-html-swipe-response-stimulus-container`. This div tag can then be styled so that they user has some visual representation of the stimulus even after the `#jspsych-html-swipe-response-stimulus-container` div has been hidden.

The plugin now ensures that both the container (`#jspsych-html-swipe-response-stimulus-container`) and the stimulus (`#jspsych-html-swipe-response-stimulus`) move together when dragged, providing a unified and seamless interaction.

## Parameters

In addition to the [parameters available in all plugins](https://www.jspsych.org/latest/overview/plugins/#parameters-available-in-all-plugins), this plugin accepts the following parameters. Parameters with a default value of *undefined* must be specified. Parameters can be left unspecified if the default value is acceptable.

| Parameter | Type | Default Value | Description |
| ----------|------|---------------|------------ |
| stimulus | HTML string | `undefined` | The HTML content to be displayed. |
| button_choices | array of strings | [] | Labels for the buttons. Each different string in the array will generate a different button. |
| keyboard_choices | array of strings | `"NO_KEYS"` | This array contains the key(s) that the participant is allowed to press in order to respond to the stimulus. Keys should be specified as characters (e.g., `'a'`, `'q'`, `' '`, `'Enter'`, `'ArrowDown'`) - see [this page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values) and [this page (event.key column)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-keycode-list-keypress-event-key-codes/) for more examples. Any key presses that are not listed in the array will be ignored. Specifying `"ALL_KEYS"` means that all keys will be accepted as valid responses. The default value of `"NO_KEYS"` will mean that no responses are allowed. |
| button_html | HTML string | `'<button class="jspsych-btn">%choice%</button>'` | A template of HTML for generating the button elements. You can override this to create customized buttons of various kinds. The string `%choice%` will be changed to the corresponding element of the `choices` array. You may also specify an array of strings, if you need different HTML to render for each button. If you do specify an array, the `choices` array and this array must have the same length. The HTML from position 0 in the `button_html` array will be used to create the button for element 0 in the `choices` array, and so on. |
| prompt | string | null | This string can contain HTML markup. Any content here will be displayed below the stimulus. The intention is that it can be used to provide a reminder about the action the participant is supposed to take (e.g., which key to press). |
| stimulus_duration | numeric | null | How long to display the stimulus in milliseconds. The visibility CSS property of the stimulus will be set to `hidden` after this time has elapsed. If this is null, then the stimulus will remain visible until the trial ends. |
| trial_duration | numeric | null | How long to wait for the participant to make a response before ending the trial in milliseconds. If the participant fails to make a response before this timer is reached, the participant's response will be recorded as null for the trial and the trial will end. If the value of this parameter is null, the trial will wait for a response indefinitely. |
| margin_vertical | string | '0px' | Vertical margin of the button(s). |
| margin_horizontal | string | '8px' | Horizontal margin of the button(s). |
| response_ends_trial | boolean | true | If true, then the trial will end whenever the participant makes a response (assuming they make their response before the cutoff specified by the `trial_duration` parameter). If false, then the trial will continue until the value for `trial_duration` is reached. You can set this parameter to `false` to force the participant to view a stimulus for a fixed amount of time, even if they respond before the time is complete. |
| swipe_threshold | numeric | 20 | How far away from the center should the participant have to swipe for a left/right response to be recorded. If the participant releases their finger before this threshold, the stimulus will return to the neutral center position. If the participant exceeds this threshold, the swipe response will be recorded. |
| swipe_offscreen_coordinate | numeric | 1000 | The offscreen coordinate for the swipe animation. |
| swipe_animation_max_rotation | numeric | 20 | How much should the swipe animation rotate the stimulus (in degrees). When the participant drags to the left (right), the stimulus will rotate slightly clockwise (counter-clockwise). */
| swipe_animation_duration | numeric | 250 | How long should the swipe animation last in milliseconds. Set this to zero to disable the animation. This animation time will not be included in the reaction time. |

## Data Generated

In addition to the [default data collected by all plugins](https://www.jspsych.org/latest/overview/plugins/#data-collected-by-all-plugins), this plugin collects the following data for each trial.

| Name      | Type    | Value                                    |
| --------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| keyboard_response | string | Indicates which key the participant pressed. If the participant responded using button clicks, then this field will be `null`. |
| button_response | numeric | Indicates which button the participant pressed. The first button in the `choices` array is 0, the second is 1, and so on. If the participant responded using the keyboard, then this field will be `null`. |
| swipe_response | string | Indicates which direction the participant swiped. This will be either `"left"` or `"right"`. If the participant responded using the keyboard, then this field will be `null`. |
| response_source | string | Indicates the source of the response. This will either be `"swipe"`, `"keyboard"`, or `"button"`. |
| rt        | numeric | The response time in milliseconds for the participant to make a response. The time is measured from when the stimulus first appears on the screen until the participant's response. |
| stimulus  | string  | The HTML content that was displayed on the screen. |

## Example

```javascript
var trial = {
  type: jsPsychHtmlSwipeResponse,
  stimulus: '<p style="font-size:48px; color:green;">BLUE</p>',
  prompt: "<p>If the ink color is red, swipe left.</p><p>If the ink color is green, swipe right.</p>"
};
```
