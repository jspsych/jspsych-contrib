# jspsych-html-swipe-response plugin

This plugin displays HTML content and records responses generated by both swipe gestures and keyboard response. This plugin will be useful for two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) assessments that will be administered on both desktop and mobile devices. The stimulus can be animated to move off-screen before the trial ends. The stimulus can be displayed until a response is given, or for a pre-determined amount of time. The trial can be ended automatically if the subject has failed to respond within a fixed length of time.

## Parameters

In addition to the [parameters available in all plugins](https://www.jspsych.org/overview/plugins#parameters-available-in-all-plugins), this plugin accepts the following parameters. Parameters with a default value of *undefined* must be specified. Parameters can be left unspecified if the default value is acceptable.

| Parameter | Type | Default Value | Description |
| ----------|------|---------------|------------ |
| stimulus | HTML string | `undefined` | The HTML content to be displayed. |
| keyboard_choices | array of strings | `"NO_KEYS"` | This array contains the key(s) that the subject is allowed to press in order to respond to the stimulus. Keys should be specified as characters (e.g., `'a'`, `'q'`, `' '`, `'Enter'`, `'ArrowDown'`) - see [this page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values) and [this page (event.key column)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-keycode-list-keypress-event-key-codes/) for more examples. Any key presses that are not listed in the array will be ignored. Specifying `"ALL_KEYS"` means that all keys will be accepted as valid responses. The default value of `"NO_KEYS"` will mean that no responses are allowed. | |
| prompt | string | null | This string can contain HTML markup. Any content here will be displayed below the stimulus. The intention is that it can be used to provide a reminder about the action the subject is supposed to take (e.g., which key to press). |
| stimulus_duration | numeric | null | How long to display the stimulus in milliseconds. The visibility CSS property of the stimulus will be set to `hidden` after this time has elapsed. If this is null, then the stimulus will remain visible until the trial ends. |
| trial_duration | numeric | null | How long to wait for the subject to make a response before ending the trial in milliseconds. If the subject fails to make a response before this timer is reached, the subject's response will be recorded as null for the trial and the trial will end. If the value of this parameter is null, the trial will wait for a response indefinitely. |
| response_ends_trial | boolean | true | If true, then the trial will end whenever the subject makes a response (assuming they make their response before the cutoff specified by the `trial_duration` parameter). If false, then the trial will continue until the value for `trial_duration` is reached. You can set this parameter to `false` to force the subject to view a stimulus for a fixed amount of time, even if they respond before the time is complete. |
| swipe_threshold | numeric | 20 | How far away from the center should the subject have to swipe for a left/right response to be recorded. If the subject releases their finger before this threshold, the stimulus will return to the neutral center position. If the subject exceeds this threshold, the swipe response will be recorded. |
| swipe_offscreen_coordinate | numeric | 1000 | The offscreen coordinate for the swipe animation. |
| swipe_animation_max_rotation | numeric | 20 | How much should the swipe animation rotate the stimulus (in degrees). When the subject drags to the left (right), the stimulus will rotate slightly clockwise (counter-clockwise). */
| swipe_animation_duration | numeric | 250 | How long should the swipe animation last in milliseconds. Set this to zero to disable the animation. This animation time will not be included in the reaction time. |

## Data Generated

In addition to the [default data collected by all plugins](../overview/plugins.md#data-collected-by-all-plugins), this plugin collects the following data for each trial.

| Name      | Type    | Value                                    |
| --------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| keyboard_response | string | Indicates which key the subject pressed. If the subject responded using button clicks, then this field will be `null`. |
| swipe_response | string | Indicates which direction the subject swiped. This will be either `"left"` or `"right"`. If the subject responded using the keyboard, then this field will be `null`. |
| response_source | string | Indicates the source of the response. This will either be `"swipe"` or `"keyboard"`. |
| rt        | numeric | The response time in milliseconds for the subject to make a response. The time is measured from when the stimulus first appears on the screen until the subject's response. |
| stimulus  | string  | The HTML content that was displayed on the screen. |

## Example

```javascript
var trial = {
  type: jsPsychHtmlSwipeResponse,
  stimulus: '<p style="font-size:48px; color:green;">BLUE</p>',
  prompt: "<p>If the ink color is red, swipe left.</p><p>If the ink color is green, swipe right.</p>"
};
```
