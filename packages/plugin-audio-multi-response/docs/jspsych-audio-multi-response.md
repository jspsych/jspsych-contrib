# jspsych-audio-multi-response plugin

This plugin plays an audio file and records responses generated by both button click and the keyboard. Allowing multiple response modalities is useful when designing assessments that will be administered on both desktop and mobile (e.g., phone or tablet) devices. The stimulus can be displayed until a response is given, or for a pre-determined amount of time. The trial can be ended automatically if the participant has failed to respond within a fixed length of time.

If the browser supports it, audio files are played using the WebAudio API. This allows for reasonably precise timing of the playback. The timing of responses generated is measured against the WebAudio specific clock, improving the measurement of response times. If the browser does not support the WebAudio API, then the audio file is played with HTML5 audio.

Audio files can be automatically preloaded by jsPsych using the preload plugin. However, if you are using timeline variables or another dynamic method to specify the audio stimulus, then you will need to manually preload the audio.

The trial can end when the participant responds, when the audio file has finished playing, or if the participant has failed to respond within a fixed length of time. You can also prevent a response from being recorded before the audio has finished playing.

## Parameters

In addition to the [parameters available in all plugins](https://www.jspsych.org/latest/overview/plugins/#parameters-available-in-all-plugins), this plugin accepts the following parameters. Parameters with a default value of *undefined* must be specified. Parameters can be left unspecified if the default value is acceptable.

| Parameter | Type | Default Value | Description |
| ----------|------|---------------|------------ |
| stimulus | audio file | `undefined` | Path to audio file to be played. |
| button_choices | array of strings | [] | Labels for the buttons. Each different string in the array will generate a different button. |
| keyboard_choices | array of strings | `"NO_KEYS"` | This array contains the key(s) that the participant is allowed to press in order to respond to the stimulus. Keys should be specified as characters (e.g., `'a'`, `'q'`, `' '`, `'Enter'`, `'ArrowDown'`) - see [this page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values) and [this page (event.key column)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-keycode-list-keypress-event-key-codes/) for more examples. Any key presses that are not listed in the array will be ignored. Specifying `"ALL_KEYS"` means that all keys will be accepted as valid responses. The default value of `"NO_KEYS"` will mean that no responses are allowed. | |
| button_html | HTML string | `'<button class="jspsych-btn">%choice%</button>'` | A template of HTML for generating the button elements. You can override this to create customized buttons of various kinds. The string `%choice%` will be changed to the corresponding element of the `choices` array. You may also specify an array of strings, if you need different HTML to render for each button. If you do specify an array, the `choices` array and this array must have the same length. The HTML from position 0 in the `button_html` array will be used to create the button for element 0 in the `choices` array, and so on. |
| prompt | string | null | This string can contain HTML markup. Any content here will be displayed below the stimulus. The intention is that it can be used to provide a reminder about the action the participant is supposed to take (e.g., which key to press). |
| prompt_above_buttons | boolean | false | If true, the prompt will display above the buttons. If false, the prompt will display below the buttons. |
| trial_duration | numeric | null | How long to wait for the participant to make a response before ending the trial in milliseconds. If the participant fails to make a response before this timer is reached, the participant's response will be recorded as null for the trial and the trial will end. If the value of this parameter is null, the trial will wait for a response indefinitely. |
| margin_vertical | string | '0px' | Vertical margin of the button(s). |
| margin_horizontal | string | '8px' | Horizontal margin of the button(s). |
| response_ends_trial | boolean | true | If true, then the trial will end whenever the participant makes a response (assuming they make their response before the cutoff specified by the `trial_duration` parameter). If false, then the trial will continue until the value for `trial_duration` is reached. You can set this parameter to `false` to force the participant to listen to the stimulus for a fixed amount of time, even if they respond before the time is complete. |
| trial_ends_after_audio | boolean | false | If true, then the trial will end as soon as the audio file finishes playing. |
| response_allowed_while_playing | boolean | true | If true, then responses are allowed while the audio is playing. If false, then the audio must finish playing before a response is accepted. Once the audio has played all the way through, a valid response is allowed (including while the audio is being re-played via on-screen playback controls). |

## Data Generated

In addition to the [default data collected by all plugins](https://www.jspsych.org/latest/overview/plugins/#data-collected-by-all-plugins), this plugin collects the following data for each trial.

| Name      | Type    | Value                                    |
| --------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| keyboard_response | string | Indicates which key the participant pressed. If the participant responded using button clicks, then this field will be `null`. |
| button_response | numeric | Indicates which button the participant pressed. The first button in the `choices` array is 0, the second is 1, and so on. If the participant responded using the keyboard, then this field will be `null`. |
| response_source | string | Indicates the source of the response. This will either be `"button"` or `"keyboard"`. |
| rt        | numeric | The response time in milliseconds for the participant to make a response. The time is measured from when the stimulus first appears on the screen until the participant's response. |
| stimulus  | string  | The HTML content that was displayed on the screen. |

## Example

```javascript
var trial = {
  type: jsPsychAudioMultiResponse,
  stimulus: 'sound/tone.mp3',
  prompt: "<p>Is the pitch high or low?</p>",
  button_choices: ["High", "Low"],
  response_ends_trials: true,
};
```
