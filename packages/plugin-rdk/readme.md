# rdk plugin

## Overview

This plugin displays a Random Dot Kinematogram (RDK) and allows the participant to report the primary direction of motion by pressing a key on the keyboard. The stimulus can be displayed until a keyboard response is given or until a certain duration of time has passed. The RDK is fully customizable (see documentation below) and can display multiple apertures at the same time, each with its own parameters.
