# jspsych-image-swipe-response plugin

This plugin displays images and records responses generated with the keyboard. The position and size of the images can be specified. The stimulus can be displayed until a response is given, or for a pre-determined amount of time. The trial can be ended automatically if the subject has failed to respond within a fixed length of time.


## Parameters

In addition to the [parameters available in all plugins](https://www.jspsych.org/overview/plugins#parameters-available-in-all-plugins), this plugin accepts the following parameters. Parameters with a default value of *undefined* must be specified. Parameters can be left unspecified if the default value is acceptable.

| Parameter                   | Type             | Default Value      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| stimulus                    | array of string  | *undefined*        | The path of the image files to be displayed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| stimulus_rect               | array of integer | null               | Set the positionX, positionY, witdh, height of the images in pixels. If left null for width and height (no value specified), then the image will display at its natural height.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| maintain_aspect_ratio       | boolean          | true               | If setting *only* the width or *only* the height and this parameter is true, then the other dimension will be scaled to maintain the image's aspect ratio.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| keyboard_choices            | array of strings | `"NO_KEYS"` | This array contains the key(s) that the subject is allowed to press in order to respond to the stimulus. Keys should be specified as characters (e.g., `'a'`, `'q'`, `' '`, `'Enter'`, `'ArrowDown'`) - see [this page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values) and [this page (event.key column)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-keycode-list-keypress-event-key-codes/) for more examples. Any key presses that are not listed in the array will be ignored. Specifying `"ALL_KEYS"` means that all keys will be accepted as valid responses. The default value of `"NO_KEYS"` will mean that no responses are allowed. |
| stimulus_duration           | numeric          | null | How long to display the stimulus in milliseconds. The visibility CSS property of the stimulus will be set to `hidden` after this time has elapsed. If this is null, then the stimulus will remain visible until the trial ends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| trial_duration              | numeric          | null | How long to wait for the subject to make a response before ending the trial in milliseconds. If the subject fails to make a response before this timer is reached, the subject's response will be recorded as null for the trial and the trial will end. If the value of this parameter is null, the trial will wait for a response indefinitely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| response_ends_trial         | boolean          | true | If true, then the trial will end whenever the subject makes a response (assuming they make their response before the cutoff specified by the `trial_duration` parameter). If false, then the trial will continue until the value for `trial_duration` is reached. You can set this parameter to `false` to force the subject to view a stimulus for a fixed amount of time, even if they respond before the time is complete.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| render_on_canvas            | boolean          | true               | If `true`, the image will be drawn onto a canvas element. This prevents a blank screen (white flash) between consecutive image trials in some browsers, like Firefox and Edge. If `false`, the image will be shown via an img element, as in previous versions of jsPsych. If the stimulus is an **animated gif**, you must set this parameter to false, because the canvas rendering method will only present static images.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Data Generated

In addition to the [default data collected by all plugins](../overview/plugins.md#data-collected-by-all-plugins), this plugin collects the following data for each trial.

| Name      | Type    | Value                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------- | ------- |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| keyboard_response | string | Indicates which key the subject pressed. If the subject responded using button clicks, then this field will be `null`.                                                      |
| rt        | numeric | The response time in milliseconds for the subject to make a response. The time is measured from when the stimulus first appears on the screen until the subject's response. |
| stimulus  | string  | The paths of the images that were displayed on the screen.                                                                                                                  |

## Example

```javascript
let trial = {
        type: jsPsychImageArrayKeyboardResponse,
        stimulus: ['./img/dot_green.png', './img/dot_yellow.png'],
        stimulus_rect: [[1000,100,200, 50],[0, 100, null, 100]],

        trial_duration: 4000,
        response_ends_trial: true,
        render_on_canvas: true,
    };
```
