# triple-handle-controller

Current version: 1.0.2. [See version history](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/blob/main/packages/plugin-triple-handle-controller/CHANGELOG.md).

This plugin displays a video and records inputs from the participant via a game controller. This plugin requires an external game controller with at least one or more analogue input devices, such as a handle or a pressure sensitive button. The recording of data starts when the user presses the record button and ends when the video stops.

The plugin will record data as indicated by the _rate_ variable (how many times it will record per second).

## Parameters

In addition to the [parameters available in all plugins](https://www.jspsych.org/latest/overview/plugins/index.html#parameters-available-in-all-plugins), this plugin accepts the following parameters. Parameters with a default value of _undefined_ must be specified. Other parameters can be left unspecified if the default value is acceptable.

## Examples

This code runs an experiment involving two levers.


```
        const videos = ["Test.webm"];

        var experiment = [
            {
                type: jsTripleHandleController,
                axis_1: 0,
                axis_2: 1,
                axis_3: 2,
                axis_location: ["L", "R", "H"],
                axis1_labels: ["No", "Maybe", "Yes"],
                axis2_labels: ["0%", "50%", "100%"],
                css_clases: ["thc-override"],
                axes_labels: ["axis1 (axis 1)", "axis2 (axis 2)", "item 3 (axis 3)"],
                title: "Follow the instructions in the video.",
                // A monitor refresh rate of 60 Hz means that
                // the screen changes every 16.7 ms or higher.
                rate: 1000 / 60, //16.777...
            },
        ];

        async function createExperiment() {
            const videoSrc = `./videos/${videos[0]}`;
            experiment[0].video_src = videoSrc;
            jsPsych.run(experiment);
