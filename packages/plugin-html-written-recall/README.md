# html-written-recall

## Overview

This plugin displays a text box for participants to write a response to a prompt. The response is saved as a string. The trial advances when a certain keyboard input is pressed (default is `Spacebar`). The idea is that a general survey-text box allows for editing as well as observing prior responses whereas this input mimics verbal free recall.
