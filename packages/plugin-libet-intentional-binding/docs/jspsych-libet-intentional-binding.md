This plugin measures intentional binding using a Libet clock, and allows the participant to estimate the timing of events by adjusting the clock hand themselves.

## Parameters

In addition to the [parameters available in all plugins](https://www.jspsych.org/overview/plugins#parameters-available-in-all-plugins), this plugin accepts the following parameters. Parameters with a default value of *undefined* must be specified. Parameters can be left unspecified if the default value is acceptable.

| Parameter                | Type             | Default Value        | Descripton                               |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| cond                     | string           | `'baseline-key'`     | Specifies the condition ("baseline-key", "baseline-tone", "operant-key", or "operant-tone"). |
| est_wo_keypress      | boolean          | false                | If `true`, and if `hand_est` is true, the participant can make an estimate even if they did not make a keypress during the trial. |
| tone_file                | audio            | undefined            | The audio file to be played, if applicable. |
| choices                  | keys             | `"ALL_KEYS"`         | The keys a participant can press, if applicable. |
| tone_delay_ms            | int              | 250                  | The time after the key press or the beginning of the clock animation that the tone is played, if applicable. |
| hand_est                 | boolean          | true                 | Specifies whether the participant moves the hand to estimate an angle. If false, the trial ends after the clock hand stops spinning. |
| instructions             | HTML string      | `''`                   | The instructions shown to the participant during estimation, if any. |
| instructions_wo_keypress             | HTML string      | undefined                   | The instructions shown to the participant during estimation if they did not make a keypress. E.g., "When did you feel the urge to make a keypress?". Only applicable if `hand_est` and `est_wo_keypress` are set to `true`. If left undefined, the parameter takes on the same value as `instructions`. |
| feedback                 | boolean          | false                | If true, and if `hand_est` is true, the participant sees feedback in the form of a black clock hand pointing in the correct direction. |
