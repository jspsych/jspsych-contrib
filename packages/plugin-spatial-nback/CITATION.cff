abstract: >-
  The N-back task is a sequential working memory challenge
  where participants monitor a continuous stream of 
  stimuli (spatial locations in this case)
  and must indicate when the current item matches the
  one presented n items earlier in the sequence.
  
  For example, in a 1-back task the participant compares each 
  stimulus to the immediately previous stimulus; in a 2-back
  task, they respond whenever the current item is the 
  same as the item two trials before, and so on.
  Participants typically press a button to signal “match”
  targets. 

  As n increases from 1 to 3, the task difficulty rises
  sharply, requiring continuous updating of the contents of
  working memory and greater attentional control to avoid
  false alarms
