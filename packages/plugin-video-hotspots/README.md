# plugin-video-hotspots

## Overview

A plugin for displaying a video that freezes on the final frame with clickable regions (hotspots). This plugin allows researchers to present a video to participants and define rectangular regions on the final frame that can be clicked like buttons. When a region is clicked or touched, visual feedback is provided and the trial records which region was selected along with response time and click coordinates.
