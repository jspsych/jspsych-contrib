# meye extension

## Overview

This plugin configures the mEye extension to collect pupillometric data. mEye is a deep-learning model developed by Fabio Carrara, who made it to run on a website for public use at https://www.pupillometry.it/. After calibrating the extension with this plugin, the extension runs in the background when added to any trial thereafter. 

Minimum requirements are a 720p 30fps webcam. This plugin must be called as a trial once in the experiment before using any trial can use the mEye extension. It can be difficult for mEye to detect participant' pupils. Use with caution.
